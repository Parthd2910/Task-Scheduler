# Task Scheduler

Built a simple task manager using PHP that lets users add, complete, and delete tasks saved in a text file. Added email subscription with a 6-digit code for verification, and sent task reminders every hour using a CRON job. Emails were sent in HTML format and included a link to unsubscribe. No database or external libraries were usedâ€”only plain PHP and text files.
